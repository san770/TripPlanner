# TripPlanner
In this, I have coded to calculate the distance to travel to all entered cities and find optimal travel path by assuming the first city entered as the starting point. I have used the haversine formula to calculate the distance between cities. Also, it will generate an interactive map in which we can pan, zoom around places to visualize.

Haversine formula
The haversine formula determines the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes. Important in navigation, it is a special case of a more general formula in spherical trigonometry, the law of haversines, that relates the sides and angles of spherical triangles.

The distance obtained will be in meter
